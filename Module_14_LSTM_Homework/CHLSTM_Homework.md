# LSTM Stock Predictor

### Build and train custom LSTM RNNs

In each Jupyter Notebook, I have created the same LSTM RNN architecture. In the one notebook, I used the FNG values. 
In the second notebook, you will fit the data using only closing prices.

Use the same parameters and training steps for each model. This is necessary to compare each model accurately.

### Evaluate the performance of each model

Use the above to answer the following: -- Trying to get with my Tutor to review my work before conclusion but I wanted to submit. 

> Which model has a lower loss?
>
> Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
>
> Which window size works best for the model?
